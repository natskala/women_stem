Comparison of the Trends of the Proportion of Women Enrolled in Biology and Life Science, Computers and Mathematics, Engineering, Health, and Physical Science Majors at the University of Florida


Motivation and Background
As a woman in a STEM field, I didnâ€™t feel the effects of the gender gap in STEM until my junior year of college, when I had several job interviews each week. I was interviewed time and time again by male interviewers who hire predominantly male employees which made female representation in companies very important to me. I asked my female friends in other STEM fields for their opinions and found that my engineering friends seemed to feel there was significantly more males than females in their engineering specific classes compared to their other classes. This made me wonder if there was a statistically significant difference in proportions for females in each STEM field. I found data from Fivethirtyeight that I could compare to the University of Florida. My goal was to find the University of Florida enrollment data, compare the female proportion for each STEM field to see how the proportion of females has changed over time, and how the University of Florida proportions compare to the other colleges.

Aims 
1 Compare the proportion of females enrolled in Biology and Life Science, Computers and Mathematics, Engineering, Health, and Physical Science majors at the University of Florida from 2014-2018

2 Compare the total proportion of females enrolled in Biology and Life Science, Computers and Mathematics, Engineering, Health, and Physical Science majors at the University of Florida from 2010-2012 to the total proportion of recent graduated females from 2010-2012 in Biology and Life Science, Computers and Mathematics, Engineering, Health, and Physical Science majors
